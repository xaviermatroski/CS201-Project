for Tic-tac-toe:
	When you will run the code the first prompt you will get is:
        "Who would make the first move? 0 for AI, 1 for you:"
        here you will have to enter 0 or 1, the number 0 is for A.I to make the
        first move and the number 1 is for you to make the first move
        if you have entered 0 the A.I will make the move, now you have to enter
        your move in "i j" form of matrix representation. The row number and
        coloumn number both are initialised to 0, which means the first cell
        will be "0 0" not "1 1"
	i: row number
	j: coloumn number

	enter move as:
	1 1
	not:
	1, 1
	(1, 1)
	11
	(1 1)

for checkers:
	Enter move as:

	1 1
	(1, 1)
	(1 1)

	the star in the board represents the location of unavailable location
	and the dash places represents the vacant places where you can make a
	move.
	Enter move in matrix representation form, here also the row and coloumn
	number are initialised to 0
	i: row number 
	j: coloumn number
